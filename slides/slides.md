who is to **judge** the living and the dead

[2 Timothy 4:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

  + proclaim / attest to **truth**
  + learned through **experience**
  + aspect of **personal** stakes
+ not "I **tell** you to do this", but

  + the **truth** of who you are
+ command in today's passage is not only
  + for "**super**"-Christians
  + pastors, those "called" to ministry
+ inasmuch as none of us are **exempt**
  + from facing **judgment**
+ the challenge given is not **optional**
  + a **hobby**, when I have **time** to
+ **this** is the **reality**:
  + Christ **will** return
  + He **will** judge every person
  + each one **must** repent, turn to Him

---
**Preach** the word

[2 Timothy 4:2a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ preach: proclaim, **herald**
  + **ambassador** in **foreign** land

+ **what** do we preach?

---
Preach **the Word**

[2 Timothy 4:2a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ ambassador carries **letter**
  + from king to foreign country

  + Bible too **hard** to understand

  + seminary only **grad school**
  + sermon, SS, BSF not **enough**
+ **lifestyle** habit of regular study
+ not in **isolation**, but
  + learned by **example**, mentorship
  + **Paul** to Timothy:

---
Follow the **pattern** of the **sound words** <br>
that you have heard from me, <br>
in the **faith** and **love** that are in Christ Jesus.

[2 Timothy 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **pattern**: type, tracing
  + **sound**: healthy, cf 4:3
+ follow **example** of healthy, grounded doctrine
  + not just **content** of Scripture
  + but **attitude** towards Scripture
+ take it **seriously**

  + or **art** whose meaning is **constructed** by viewer
+ **message** from the King to this foreign land

+ **when** do we deliver the message?

---
be **ready** in season and out of season

[2 Timothy 4:2b (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ at **good** / opportune time, and

  + wherever God **wants** us to be
  + anywhere, anytime, even **grocery**

  + what **Christ** has done: **grace**
+ **holiness** &rArr; **sin** &rArr; **grace**

---
reprove, **rebuke**, and exhort

[2 Timothy 4:2c (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (ἐπιτίμησον): root is **honour**
  + to **esteem**, assign **value**
+ e.g., teacher handing back **exams**:
  + "great job! great job! **meh...** great job!"

  + God has already **revealed** 
  + what He **requires** of man

  + to **our** actions + priorities
+ give **warning** and
  + direct **back** to right path

reprove, rebuke, and **exhort**

+ (παρακάλεσον): **encourage**
  + advocate, defend, implore
+ be **called** alongside (passive):
  + by those who are about to **fall**
  + **carry** burden, **walk** beside
+ **call** alongside (active):
  + **invite** into community
+ not forever **labelling** them as outsiders
+ **join** with the **family** of God
  + and the **work** of His kingdom
+ e.g., JJ @4yo tantrum wanting toy:
+ reprove: calm down and
  + **walk through** what just happened
  + wanted a **toy** but didn't get it
  + got **angry**, cried, hit mom, threw toys
  + "**fine!**", poor attitude
+ rebuke: what is **ok** / not-ok
  + what is **important** / not
  + ok: **wanting** a toy, saying so gently
  + ok: being **disappointed**
  + not ok: getting **angry** / bitter
  + JJ: angry doesn't **matter**
  + attitude more **important** than toy / play
+ exhort: restore, **encourage**
  + **sit** with him until calm, understands, repents
  + tangible **steps** to rebuild rl
    + pray, sorry, care for mom, pick up thrown toys
    + this doesn't **pay** for damage done
  + but provides a **path** home

with complete **patience** and **teaching**. 

[2 Timothy 4:2d (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **patience** (μακροθυμίᾳ): long/slow **inflammation**

  + cf easily **set off** by small obstacles
  + James 1:19 **slow to anger**
  + **fruit** of Spirit: pursue **HS**, not fruit
+ **teaching** (διδαχῇ): **rl** of teacher-student
  + not just "**sage** on stage"

  + Paul the **mentor** describes
  + to Timothy the **apprentice**:
