## Preach the Word [(2Tim4)](# "ref")
1. **Proclamation** [(v1-2)](# "ref")
1. **Opposition** [(v3-4)](# "ref")
1. **Calling** [(v5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Timothy**: young pastor in Ephesus
  + Paul: **mentor** ("true **son** in the faith")
+ 1 Tim: instr regarding **church**
+ 2 Tim: more **personal**, about Timothy **himself**
+ repeated **structure**:
  + **tasks** / charge for Timothy
  + **warning** about those who would oppose gospel
  + "**but you**", persevere in proven character
+ ch4a: **climax** of letter, 
  + **strongest** distillation of this structure
  + focus mostly on **action** (v1-2)
+ Paul uses a strong + personal **imperative** in v1:

---
I **charge** you <br>
in the presence of God and of **Christ Jesus**, <br>
who is to **judge** the living and the dead

[2 Timothy 4:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ intensified form of root, **testify**
  + proclaim / attest to **truth**
  + learned through **experience**
  + aspect of **personal** stakes
+ not "I **tell** you to do this", but
  + "This is what you **need** to do"
  + the **truth** of who you are
+ command in today's passage is not only
  + for "**super**"-Christians
  + pastors, those "called" to ministry
+ inasmuch as none of us are **exempt**
  + from facing **judgment**
+ the challenge given is not **optional**
  + a **hobby**, when I have **time** to
+ **this** is the **reality**:
  + Christ **will** return
  + He **will** judge every person
  + each one **must** repent, turn to Him
+ so we **must** proclaim this!

---
**Preach** the word; <br>
be **ready** in season and out of season; <br>
**reprove**, **rebuke**, and **exhort**, <br>
with complete **patience** and **teaching**. 

[2 Timothy 4:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Primary **imperative** is "preach"
  + **what** to preach
  + **when** to preach
  + **actions** how to preach
  + **attitude** how to preach
+ Paul **charges** Tim:
  + solemn **declaration**
+ this is **who you are**
  + it is **objective** truth
  + I see it **personally**, too
+ you were **made** to do this:

---
**Preach** the word

[2 Timothy 4:2a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ preach: proclaim, **herald**
  + **ambassador** in **foreign** land
+ speaks only what **king** sends
  + but with full **authority** of king
+ **citizenship** not of this world
  + but earnestly **care** for the land we live in
+ communicate God's **judgment**
  + and Christ's **mercy**
+ **what** do we preach?

---
Preach **the Word**

[2 Timothy 4:2a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ ambassador carries **letter**
  + from king to foreign country
+ "but I don't **know** what to say!"
  + Bible too **hard** to understand
+ only for **seminary** grads?
  + seminary only **grad school**
  + sermon, SS, BSF not **enough**
+ **lifestyle** habit of regular study
+ not in **isolation**, but
  + learned by **example**, mentorship
  + **Paul** to Timothy:

---
Follow the **pattern** of the **sound words** <br>
that you have heard from me, <br>
in the **faith** and **love** that are in Christ Jesus.

[2 Timothy 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **pattern**: type, tracing
  + **sound**: healthy, cf 4:3
+ follow **example** of healthy, grounded doctrine
  + not just **content** of Scripture
  + but **attitude** towards Scripture
+ take it **seriously**
  + not as **fable** / allegory
  + or **art** whose meaning is **constructed** by viewer
+ **message** from the King to this foreign land
  + we are the **ambassadors** carrying the message
+ **when** do we deliver the message?

---
be **ready** in season and out of season

[2 Timothy 4:2b (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ at **good** / opportune time, and
+ when there is **no** time
  + not **convenient**
+ ready: **stand** upon, be present
  + "half the battle is **showing up**"
+ we like to **schedule** when HS can move
  + special **Christmas** outreach
  + evangelistic meetings, **altar call**
+ standing **ready** means being **present**
  + wherever God **wants** us to be
  + anywhere, anytime, even **grocery**
+ e.g., praying at **Save-On**
  + not for **her** sake, but **mine**
  + be **prepared**: to pray, to **speak**
+ **how** do we proclaim God's Word?

---
**reprove**, rebuke, and exhort

[2 Timothy 4:2c (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ 3 **imperatives** that expand on 
  + the **actions** of how to preach
+ **reprove** (ἔλεγξον): expose, convict, demonstrate
  + **lay out** evidence clearly
  + judge: finding of **fact**, what **happened**
+ not that **we** are the judge! God is
  + not that we are **perfect**:
  + illustrate being **forgiven**
+ who **God** is: his **holiness**
  + who **we** are: made to be **holy**
  + but **fallen** in rebellion to His authority
  + what **Christ** has done: **grace**
+ **holiness** &rArr; **sin** &rArr; **grace**

---
reprove, **rebuke**, and exhort

[2 Timothy 4:2c (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (ἐπιτίμησον): root is **honour**
  + to **esteem**, assign **value**
+ e.g., teacher handing back **exams**:
  + "great job! great job! **meh...** great job!"
+ **we** do not **judge** anyone
  + God has already **revealed** 
  + what He **requires** of man
+ **rebuke** means applying God's standard
  + to **our** actions + priorities
+ give **warning** and
  + direct **back** to right path
  + to **encourage**:

---
reprove, rebuke, and **exhort**

[2 Timothy 4:2c (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (παρακάλεσον): **encourage**
  + advocate, defend, implore
+ be **called** alongside (passive):
  + by those who are about to **fall**
  + **carry** burden, **walk** beside
+ **call** alongside (active):
  + **invite** into community
+ not forever **labelling** them as outsiders
+ **join** with the **family** of God
  + and the **work** of His kingdom
+ e.g., JJ @4yo tantrum wanting toy:
+ reprove: calm down and
  + **walk through** what just happened
  + wanted a **toy** but didn't get it
  + got **angry**, cried, hit mom, threw toys
  + "**fine!**", poor attitude
+ rebuke: what is **ok** / not-ok
  + what is **important** / not
  + ok: **wanting** a toy, saying so gently
  + ok: being **disappointed**
  + not ok: getting **angry** / bitter
  + JJ: angry doesn't **matter**
  + attitude more **important** than toy / play
+ exhort: restore, **encourage**
  + **sit** with him until calm, understands, repents
  + tangible **steps** to rebuild rl
    + pray, sorry, care for mom, pick up thrown toys
    + this doesn't **pay** for damage done
  + but provides a **path** home

---
with complete **patience** and **teaching**. 

[2 Timothy 4:2d (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **patience** (μακροθυμίᾳ): long/slow **inflammation**
  + take a **long time** before getting **angry**
  + cf easily **set off** by small obstacles
  + James 1:19 **slow to anger**
  + **fruit** of Spirit: pursue **HS**, not fruit
+ **teaching** (διδαχῇ): **rl** of teacher-student
  + not just "**sage** on stage"
  + train **whole** person
  + with **principles** (Scripture, study)
  + but also **practise** (example, apprentice)
+ this is the primary **charge** 
  + Paul the **mentor** describes
  + to Timothy the **apprentice**:

For the time is coming when people <br>
will not **endure sound teaching**,

[2 Timothy 4:3a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>
+ v3-4 pair of **contrasts**:
  + **teaching**
  + **turning**
+ Paul **warns** Timothy
  + so he won't be **alarmed**
  + or **faint**, or **frustrated**
  + when he encounters them
+ e.g., 1st time **SkyTrain**:
  + if don't **hold on**, will fall
  + if **warned**, won't be **surprised**
+ in our **society**, we should **expect**:
  + first, a battle of competing **principles**
+ **sound teaching**: healthy, proper
  + the way our lives+rl were **meant** to be
+ **endure** (ἀνέξονται): bear, put up with
  + can't **stand** it, too much
+ so what **voices** will they listen to?

---
but having **itching** ears <br>
they will **accumulate** for themselves <br>
teachers to suit their own **passions**, 

[2 Timothy 4:3b (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **passions** (ἐπιθυμίας): flame, upswelling of desire
  + for **pleasure**, fun, thrill
  + for **pride**, admiration, power
+ **accumulate** (ἐπισωρεύσουσιν): pile up
  + **surround** w/wall of overwhelming majority
  + **loud** enough, **numerous** enough
  + to **drown out** healthy teaching
+ **itching** (κνηθόμενοι): tickle, scratch
  + not to pursue **truth**, but
  + to **satisfy** own need for validation
+ "I'm **happy** with that explanation"
  + "This author really **appeals** to me"
+ rejecting God's **teaching** leads to
  + a willful change of **direction**:

---
and will **turn away** from listening to the truth <br>
and **wander off** into **myths**. 

[2 Timothy 4:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ turn **away** (ἀποστρέψουσιν) from truth
+ wander off (ἐκτραπήσονται): turn **out** / aside
  + any other **direction** off the main **road**
  + 1 **truth**, infinite **falsehoods**
+ **myth**: speech, tall tale:
  + fiction **pretending** to be truth
  + "movie inspired by true events"
+ e.g., The **Shack**:
  + **fiction**, but claims to **represent** what God would say
  + made up based on **own** experiences
  + rather than **Scripture**
+ **expect** our society to turn to these!
  + **orientation**: once turned away from truth,
  + **natural** path is to continue further away
  + takes **deliberate** effort to turn **back**
+ How should we **respond**?
  + earlier in ch2:

---
The Lord's servant must not be **quarrelsome** <br>
but **kind** to everyone, able to **teach**, <br>
patiently **enduring** evil, <br>
[25](# "ref")
**correcting** his opponents with **gentleness**. 

[2 Timothy 2:24-25 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God may perhaps grant them **repentance**
  + turn **back** toward God's truth
+ but more **time** will not help:
  + w/o a change of **direction**,
  + they will only wander **farther** away

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
